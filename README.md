Simply asked gemini.google.com: Based on the figure can you create a dataframe of SEC standards for a superdex 75 10/300gl column with protein names, mw and elution volumes? And got the first block of the jupyter notebook. The theory esentially comes from asking gimini: Could you give the theory behind size exclusion column calibration in latex to be pasted into a volab notebook. Did the rest myself :-). The script gives the MW of a sample with a given elution volume.
